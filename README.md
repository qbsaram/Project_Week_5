## <a id="project-description"></a>Project Description
The objective of this project is choosing a topic that interests you, finding related data, completing an end-to-end analysis and presenting your findings all by yourself. Understand what research has already been done in that area and find questions that are still unanswered. Then, look for data that you think could help you answer those questions and analyze it using visualizations to support your reasoning. Finally, present your result in a presentation and a technical paper.
